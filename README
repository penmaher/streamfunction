This repo contains two files.

StreamFunction_riemann_sums.py 
    - The purpose of the code is to compute the meridional mass stream function
    - This is done by integrating the meridional wind (vcomp) and the pressure
      vertical velocity (omega). The integration is done using Riemann sums.
    - See files for refs, equations, etc.

StreamFunction_old_method.py 
    - this file is here for the authors legacy. It should not be used.
    - It has been superseded by StreamFunction_riemann_sums.py
